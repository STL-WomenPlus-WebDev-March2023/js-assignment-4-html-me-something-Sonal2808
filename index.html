               <h2>Rajasthan</h2>
               <p>
                  Rajasthan,<b>the land of Kings</b>, is a worthy etymology, owing to the rich heritage founded by the Maharajas who once ruled with pride their kingdoms. A significant portion of <b>Rajasthani</b> land is a golden sand carpet that is otherwise known as the <b>Thar Desert</b>. There is also the Aravalli Range with the magnificent <b>Mount Abu</b> adding to Rajasthan's geographical splendour. But this isn't it needs to boast about. The heart of Rajasthan's <b>tourism</b> lies in its cities,Whether it is Jodhpur-<b>"The blue city"</b>, or Udaipur-<b>"The city of lakes"</b> or Jaisalmer-<b>"The Golden city"</b>, you feel beauty of vibrant culture of Rajasthan everywhere.</p>

                  <h2>Kerala</h2>
                  <p>
                     The southwestern state of India known as Kerala is a place of tropical beauty. Palm trees, white sand beaches and eco-tourism are all big reasons to explore the region. Besides its famous backwaters, elegant houseboats and temple festivals, Kerala is also home to Thekkady, a tiger preserve which allows you to admire flora and fauna without crowds. The hub of Kerala is the city of Kochi, where you can see the local fishing industry thriving along with modern high-rises and colonial architecture. Kochi is ethnically and religiously diverse, and in a single afternoon you can explore a Jewish synagogue, a Dutch palace, the Portuguese Pallipuram Fort and the Hindu Thrikkakara Temple. </p>

                        <h2>Mumbai</h2>
                        <p>
                           There are plenty of reasons why Mumbai in India is well worth a visit. It isn’t just for city-lovers. There’s plenty that it has to offer nature-lovers as well. The Sanjay Gandhi National Park, the largest urban park located within city limits is rich with rare flora and fauna in addition to a resident tiger population. Vast and dense, the forested park is ideal for treks, bird-watching and more. If that doesn’t please you, the city is in close proximity to some of the country’s best trekking destinations – from Harishchandragad to Kalsubai peak. Surrounded by the calming waters of the Arabian Sea, Mumbai is a city for sea-lovers and beach babies. Mumbai is one of the best cities to head to if you are looking to get a feel of the contemporary art scene in India. From Chapel Road’s iconic street art to Jehangir Art Gallery and the many other famous galleries of Kala Ghoda, Mumbai has plenty to offer art enthusiasts. And if you’re an art history aficionado, then the city’s historic cave temples and its many museums including the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya and the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum will delight you.</p>

                              <h2>Delhi</h2>
                              <p>If you’re spending any time in Northern India, you will almost certainly visit the capital city of Delhi. The enormous sprawling destination is home to several districts, and it is considered to be one of the oldest cities in the world. One of the top sights in Delhi is the Red Fort, or Lal Qila, which was built in the 17th century. The Red Fort is made from sandstone, and you will be able to walk through its Lahore Gate, into the bazaar, through the jewel palace and even into the former residence of the sultan. While in Delhi, you should also make time for the many museums and religious structures that make up the city.

                                    <h2>Kashmir</h2>
                                    <p>The valley of Kashmir is as rich with history and political controversy as it is with culture and natural phenomena. Sample exquisitely spiced native cuisines and festive teas, then walk off your meal along the rugged trekking routes to the north. Marvel at the famous houseboats of Srinagar and take a spiritual moment to reflect at one of the many pilgrimage sites and religious shrines that dot the region. Of course, native craftsmanship makes for excellent souvenirs—carpets and textiles are an especial shopping must.
